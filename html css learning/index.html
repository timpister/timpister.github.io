	<p>Mexican restaurants in Northern Utah seem to be a dime a dozen, but El Mexiquense Grill stands above the crowd. The restaurant serves classic – and authentic – Mexican fare with favorites like chimichangas, tacos pastor, and molcajetes. The interior of the restaurant is clean and inviting. It boasts a few large TV sets, so guests can enjoy the latest popular sporting event.

El Mexiquense  Grill also serves a killer elotes: a popular Mexican street food of corn on the cob, spread with mayonnaise, herbs, and cotija cheese and served hot. Guests especially like the salsa bar – a buffet of homemade condiments where diners can try multiple different flavors and levels of spicy heat.</p>
